Description (from http://code.google.com/p/msinttypes):

This project fills the absence of stdint.h and inttypes.h in Microsoft
Visual Studio. This files were standartized by ISO/IEC as a part of C99
standard library. If you want to compile or use C99 compliant project with
Microsoft Visual Studio, you will likely find that you're missing these
headers. Note though, that just adding these header does not make Visual
Studio compiler fully C99 compliant.
